# SimpleChat
A simple one page chat app that I've been using as a sand box for practicing and playing with new technologies as I learn them. So far there's been two versions.

## Version 1

Very basic client side chat app with three different bots, all done with JQuery and basic HTML and CSS.

## Version 2

Added a backend with Node, using Koa and a PostgreSQL db.

## Version 3 

Migrated client to Angular
